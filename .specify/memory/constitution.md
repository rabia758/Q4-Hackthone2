# Evolution of Todo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-First Development
All code MUST be generated by Claude Code; Humans must NOT write implementation code. This ensures consistency, quality, and adherence to spec-driven development principles throughout the project lifecycle.

### II. Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Mandate
Every feature requires a written Markdown specification; Specs must be refined until Claude produces correct output. This provides clear requirements, testable acceptance criteria, and prevents scope creep.

### III. Phase-by-Phase Progression
Each phase must live in its own folder with its own `sp.specify.md`; Skipping phases is forbidden. This ensures proper architectural evolution and prevents technical shortcuts that could compromise the project's integrity.

### IV. Agentic Dev Stack Utilization
Sub-agents and skills must be used as complexity increases; All code MUST be generated by Claude Code. This leverages AI capabilities effectively while maintaining structured development practices.

### V. Feature Evolution Model
Implementation must follow the progressive feature model: Basic (CRUD operations) → Intermediate (Priorities, Tags, Search) → Advanced (AI, Natural Language). This ensures steady progression and prevents feature bloat.

### VI. Sub-Agent Collaboration
Agents must collaborate through specs, not code; Each agent has defined responsibilities (Product, Backend, Frontend, AI, DevOps). This maintains clear separation of concerns while enabling coordinated development.

## Technology Constraints

### Development Stack Requirements
- Phase I: Python, in-memory structures, console interface
- Phase II: Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, SQLModel ORM, Neon Postgres
- Phase III: OpenAI ChatKit, OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP SDK
- Phase IV: Docker, Minikube, Helm, kubectl-ai, kagent
- Phase V: Kafka, Dapr, DigitalOcean Kubernetes

### Prohibited Actions
- Manual coding outside of Claude Code
- Skipping specifications
- Merging phase folders
- Ignoring agent responsibilities
- Hardcoded secrets or credentials

## Development Workflow

### Specification Requirements
- Each phase requires its own `sp.specify.md` file
- Specifications must include acceptance criteria
- All changes must be spec-driven before implementation

### Quality Gates
- All code must be AI-generated
- Every phase must be completed before advancing
- Specifications must be validated before implementation
- Proper repository structure must be maintained

## Governance

This constitution is the highest authority for the Evolution of Todo project. All development activities must comply with these principles. Amendments require explicit documentation of changes and approval from project stakeholders. All PRs and reviews must verify constitution compliance. The project succeeds only when all 5 phases are completed with AI-generated code following strict SDD methodology.

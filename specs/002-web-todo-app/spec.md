# Specification: Phase II — Full-Stack Web Todo Application

---

## 1. Purpose

Upgrade the Phase I console-based Todo application into a modern,
full-stack web application with persistent storage, authentication,
and a responsive user interface.

This phase introduces:
- Client-server architecture
- RESTful APIs
- Database persistence
- Authentication
- Modern UI/UX

All implementation must be generated by Claude Code using
Spec-Kit Plus.

---

## 2. Target Audience

- Hackathon evaluators
- Full-stack developers
- AI-assisted development workflows
- Users managing personal todos via web

---

## 3. Scope

### Included
- Web-based Todo management
- RESTful API backend
- User authentication
- Persistent database storage
- Responsive frontend UI

### Excluded
- AI chatbot
- Kubernetes deployment
- Notifications
- Recurring tasks

---

## 4. Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js 16+
- App Router
- Responsive design
- Client-side routing

### Backend
- Python FastAPI
- RESTful APIs

### ORM
- SQLModel

### Database
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL

### Authentication
- Better Auth (signup & signin)

### Development
- Claude Code
- Spec-Kit Plus

---

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Authentication (Mandatory)

#### User Signup
- Users can create an account
- Required fields:
  - Email
  - Password
- Passwords must be securely stored
- Duplicate emails must be rejected

#### User Signin
- Users can log in with valid credentials
- Authenticated session must persist
- Unauthorized users must not access todos

---

### 5.2 Todo Management (Basic Level – All 5 Features)

Each todo is **owned by a user**.

#### Add Todo
- Authenticated users can create todos
- Fields:
  - Title (required)
  - Description (optional)
  - Completed (default: false)

#### View Todos
- Users can view only their own todos
- Todos displayed in a list format

#### Update Todo
- Users can update:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Completion status

#### Delete Todo
- Users can delete their own todos
- Confirmation required on UI

#### Mark Todo as Complete
- Users can toggle completion
- Completed todos visually distinguished

---

## 6. RESTful API Requirements

### Authentication APIs
- POST `/auth/signup`
- POST `/auth/signin`

### Todo APIs (Authenticated)
- POST `/todos`
- GET `/todos`
- PUT `/todos/{id}`
- DELETE `/todos/{id}`

All endpoints must:
- Follow REST conventions
- Return proper HTTP status codes
- Validate user ownership

---

## 7. Data Model (Conceptual)

### User
- id (UUID)
- email (unique)
- password_hash
- created_at

### Todo
- id (UUID)
- user_id (FK)
- title
- description
- completed
- created_at
- updated_at

---

## 8. Frontend UI Requirements

### UI Inspiration
Design must follow a **modern minimalist UI**
similar to:
https://todo-chi-neon.vercel.app/

### Required UI Characteristics
- Clean layout
- Soft shadows
- Rounded cards
- Minimal color palette
- Smooth transitions
- Mobile-first responsiveness

---

### Screens

#### Authentication Pages
- Signup page
- Signin page
- Error feedback for invalid input

#### Todo Dashboard
- Header with user session
- Add todo input
- Todo list cards
- Checkbox for completion
- Edit & delete actions

---

## 9. User Flow

1. User opens app
2. Redirected to signin/signup
3. Authenticates successfully
4. Lands on todo dashboard
5. Manages todos
6. Logs out

---

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements

- Responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
- Clear error messages
- Fast API response times
- Secure authentication
- Clean code structure (AI-generated)

---

## 11. Constraints

- ❌ No manual coding
- ❌ No AI features
- ❌ No Kubernetes or Docker
- ❌ No file-based storage
- ✅ SQLModel ORM only
- ✅ Better Auth only for authentication
- ✅ Claude Code must generate all code

---

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

Phase II is complete when:

- Users can sign up and sign in
- Todos persist across sessions
- Each user sees only their own todos
- UI resembles modern todo app style
- Backend exposes RESTful APIs
- Database runs on Neon
- All code is AI-generated

---

## 13. Validation Checklist

- [ ] Authentication enforced
- [ ] CRUD operations functional
- [ ] Database persistence confirmed
- [ ] UI responsive and clean
- [ ] No Phase III features present
- [ ] Spec-driven workflow respected

---

## 14. Explicitly Out of Scope

- AI chatbot
- Natural language commands
- Kubernetes deployment
- Event streaming
- Notifications

---

## 15. Completion Signal

When Claude Code generates a working full-stack
application meeting all requirements without
manual code edits, Phase II is considered complete.

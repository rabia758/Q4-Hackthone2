# PHR-0001: Phase 4 Specification Created

## Prompt Text

```
--feature="004-k8s-deployment"
```

## Response Text

Created comprehensive specification for local Kubernetes deployment of the AI Todo Chatbot, including user scenarios, functional requirements, and success criteria.

## Outcome & Impact

Successfully created the Phase 4 specification for deploying the AI Todo Chatbot to a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. The spec includes containerization requirements, AI-assisted Kubernetes operations, and deployment validation criteria.

## Files Summary

- specs/004-k8s-deployment/spec.md: Complete feature specification
- specs/004-k8s-deployment/checklists/requirements.md: Quality validation checklist
- phase-4-local-k8s/README.md: Phase documentation

## Tests Summary

No tests created yet; specification phase complete and ready for planning.

## Next Prompts

/sp.plan --feature="004-k8s-deployment"

## Reflection Note

The specification successfully captures the requirements for AI-assisted Kubernetes deployment while maintaining focus on user value and measurable outcomes.

## Failure Modes Observed

None observed; all required components were successfully created.

## Next Experiment

Implement the deployment plan following the created specification.
